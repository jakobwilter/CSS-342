# CSS-342

COURSE NAME: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics I

COURSE SUMMARY: Integrating mathematical principles with detailed instruction in computer programming. Explores 
mathematical reasoning and discrete structures through object-oriented programming. Includes algorithm analysis, 
basic abstract data types, and data structures. May not be repeated. 
Prerequisite: CSS 133, CSS 143, CSE 143, or CSS 162; STMATH 125 or MATH 125.

This fast-paced course sequence (with CSS343) is intended to bring entering students' backgrounds up to a level 
where they can take Junior and Senior level CSS courses. By the end of this quarter, students will be familiar 
with much of the C++ language and the basics of object-oriented programming. Students will understand how to analyze 
a problem and design a solution. You will know many basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, 
running time, and implementation time associated with them. 

Topics include: data abstraction, mathematical induction, propositions quantifiers, proofs, recursion, computational 
complexity and algorithm analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, and object-oriented methods.
